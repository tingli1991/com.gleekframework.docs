# Quick Start

Before starting, it's recommended that everyone first installs the [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) server-side service. We recommend [Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/) for this, and there are plenty of tutorials online, so I wonâ€™t go into too much detail here.

> Reasons for not uploading to [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) official

- On one hand, it is more recommended to build your own [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) server-side service, which is more secure when privatized.
- On the other hand, it is hoped that the project can be iterated and receive feedback continuously.
- Together we build the .NET community, so that .NET development is no longer anxious about finding jobs.

> Why recommend [Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/)

- [Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/) is currently a widely used binary repository management tool with powerful features and flexible configuration options.
- [Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/) supports proxying remote repositories and hosting local repositories, capable of managing packages in various formats such as Maven, npm, NuGet, and more.
- Compared to traditional nuget servers, [Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/) offers more comprehensive repository management features. For instance, [Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/) supports group repositories, allowing users to access and search multiple repositories through a single gateway.

## Core Components Explanation

The so-called core components refer to the foundational elements that all our components depend upon. These components serve as the basis for the implementation of all our components. For example: IOC.

> Com.GleekFramework.AutofacSdk

- All IOC within the project is based on it, and you can activate it using the UseAutofac() method.

> Com.GleekFramework.ConfigSdk

- All configuration file reading within the project is uniformly done through it. Use the UseConfig() method to activate it, and if you want to activate feature configurations, you can use the UseConfigAttribute() method.

## WEB Site Injection Example

The following injections are for reference only, the actual project application needs to use the corresponding component, you can find the corresponding injection method in the corresponding Hostings directory.

    }
}
```

## Console Injection Example

If your project's API end and its consumers are separated, the consumer side can use a console application, and the API side can use a web-based approach to reduce dependencies.
