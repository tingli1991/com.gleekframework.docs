# Structure Recommendation

Here is a project interface that I have personally summarized after years of working on various projects. I hope this will assist you all during your development process and aim to minimize any worries regarding project structure setup. Please note, it's not necessary to build all these directories right from the start according to this recommendation. The idea here is not to prescribe, but to guide. In case you find yourself uncertain about how to set up your project structure, this can serve as a quick reference to find the answers you need.
