## Overview

gleekframework is a high-performance and minimalist collection of .NET component libraries suitable for handling high-traffic websites. It adopts a distributed architecture and microservices design philosophy, proven by the ordeal of a single day peak of 40 billion PV. The framework follows the principle of simplicity, with convention over configuration as the basic tenet, helping developers to quickly build stable and reliable systems.
Whether it's a large enterprise-level project or a small application, this framework can meet the needs, providing efficient development and deployment solutions, while also featuring an extremely simple and unified code style.
